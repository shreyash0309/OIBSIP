          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> (15 October 1931 â€“ 27
            July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
            president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
            engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
            science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
            space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus
            came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
            development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He
            also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role
            in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the
            original nuclear test by India in 1974.

          <h2><u>Early Life and Education</u></h2>
          <p>
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to
            a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on
            Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of
            Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and
            imam of a local mosque, his mother Ashiamma was a
            housewife.<br>
            The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. 
            <b>As a young boy he had to sell newspapers</b> to add to the family's meager income.<br>
            In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and
            hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.
            After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend 
            Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated 
            in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.

                After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical

                Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential 
                election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. 
                His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.
              </li>
              <li>
                During his term as president, he was affectionately known as the People's President, saying that 
                signing the Office of Profit Bill was the toughest decision he had taken during his tenure.
                Kalam was criticised for his inaction in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions 
                submitted to him during his tenure.

                In September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh, Kalam supported the need of 
                Uniform Civil Code in India, keeping in view the population of the country.
              </li>
              <li>
                At the end of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness to consider 
                a second term in office provided there was certainty about his victory in the 2007 
                presidential election. However, two days later, he decided not to contest the Presidential 
                election again stating that he wanted to avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political processes.
